# Student-Handler-Get-Fluent

This is a first approach on how to use CRUD for students in Get Fluent. It uses Node.js, Express and MySQL for the server.

## Packages:

1)<code>npm init -y</code> to install package.json

2)<code>npm install express</code>

3)<code>npm install mysql</code>

4)<code>npm install dotenv</code> to have a place where to store all of the configurations for the database (password, username).

5)<code>npm install nodemon</code> so everytime that we make changes to our script, we won't have to restart the server. It'll watch and load it for us.

6)<code>npm install cors</code> to make API calls from the front-end to the back-end.
